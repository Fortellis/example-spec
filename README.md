# Combined Spec Repository

From this repository, you can access the the examples specs for the following:

* **Synchronous APIs:** In synchronous APIs, the caller sends the request and then waits for the response to that request.
* **Asynchronous APIs:** In asynchronous APIs, the server has updated information and sends the payload to the app in response to a change on the server's end.

For more information on synchronous APIs specs, see [OpenAPI Guidelines](https://docs.fortellis.io/docs/tutorials/spec-provider/api-spec-introduction/).

For more information on asynchronous APIs, see [Asynchronous API Overview](https://docs.fortellis.io/docs/tutorials/event-relay/overview/).
